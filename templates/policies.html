    <h2>Terms of Service</h2>
    <p>By using CareerMentor, you agree to engage with our platform responsibly. Our AI tools, such as Resume Analysis and Career Roadmaps, provide guidance—not guaranteed outcomes. Users are encouraged to verify information and make informed decisions based on personal judgment.</p>
    <p>You agree not to misuse the system, attempt unauthorized access, upload harmful files, or engage in activity that disrupts service functionality. CareerMentor reserves the right to update features, modify policies, or suspend accounts involved in misuse. Continued use of the platform signifies acceptance of any updated terms.</p>
    <p>Users must be at least 16 years old to use the platform. By creating an account, you confirm that the information you provide is accurate and up‑to‑date. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your login credentials and for any activities that occur under your account.</p>
    <p>We may temporarily restrict platform features during maintenance or upgrades. In such cases, CareerMentor will strive to maintain transparency and minimize downtime. We are not liable for decisions made solely based on AI recommendations, as final responsibility rests with the user.</p>

    <h2>AI Ethics Policy</h2>
    <p>CareerMentor is built on responsible AI principles, ensuring fairness, transparency, and accountability. Our recommendations are designed to support your career growth without discrimination relating to gender, age, background, or socioeconomic status.</p>
    <p>We rigorously test our models to reduce bias and ensure ethical decision‑making. No automated decision is made without user visibility. CareerMentor does not store sensitive personal data unless explicitly provided by the user, and even then, it is protected with strict safeguards. We are committed to building AI that supports opportunity and fairness for everyone.</p>
    <p>Our AI systems are trained using diverse datasets to minimize structural and historical biases. We regularly audit model performance to detect unintended behavior, ensuring that the guidance provided is both relevant and inclusive for all users.</p>
    <p>CareerMentor emphasizes explainability: users should understand why the AI makes certain recommendations. When possible, our platform provides clear reasoning or contributing factors behind suggestions, supporting transparency and user trust.</p>
    <p>We encourage feedback from users to continue improving our AI responsibly. Any concerns regarding model behavior, fairness, or accuracy are promptly reviewed by our development team to maintain the highest ethical standards.</p>
